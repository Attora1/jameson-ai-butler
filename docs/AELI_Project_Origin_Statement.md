## Summary  
AELI is a proactive, neurodivergent-friendly AI butler and life assistant designed to support executive function, energy management, and emotional regulation through an intuitive chat interface and customizable modes (e.g., Focus Mode, Low Spoon Mode, Crisis Mode).

Inspired by personal lived experience and grounded in inclusive design, AELI blends thoughtful UX with mental health support tools like timers, breathing exercises, AI memory assistance, partner support logic, and style customization. It integrates voice, mood, and accessibility features — all tailored to meet the needs of people who often fall through the cracks of traditional productivity tools.
